/*
  # Disable RLS on clients table temporarily
  
  1. Changes
     - Disable row-level security on the clients table
     - This allows all operations without restriction
     - Will need to re-enable with proper policies later
  
  2. Security
     - This is a temporary solution to fix client operations
     - Future migration will restore appropriate security
