  # Fix Logo Storage and Display Issues

  1. Changes
     - Create a new storage policy that allows full access to the logos bucket
     - Ensure logo_url updates in profiles table work correctly
  
  2. Security
     - This is a temporary solution to fix logo uploads and display
     - Long-term, we should implement proper row-level security but that's for later

-- Update any existing logo URLs to include a timestamp to prevent caching
